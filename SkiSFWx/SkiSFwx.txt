STEPS TO IMPLEMENT:

Server-side Script:

- The .dat file needs to be read on the server side. This can be done using a backend language like Python or PHP.
- The server script reads the .dat file and sends its content to the frontend in a readable format (e.g., JSON or plain text).

Frontend Page:

- The HTML page will use JavaScript to periodically fetch updated data from the server (every 20 minutes using setInterval).
- The JavaScript parses the data and updates the table dynamically.

Deployment:

- You need a web server (e.g., Apache, NGINX, Flask) to host the page and serve the data.


* Access the endpoint at http://localhost:5000/get_weather_data. It will return the latest data in JSON format.


HOW IT WORKS: 

Backend:

- Reads the continuously updated .dat file.
- Serves the latest 50 rows (or any desired number) as a JSON response via an API endpoint (/get_weather_data).

Frontend:

- Fetches data from the endpoint every 20 minutes using setInterval.
- Dynamically updates the table with the new data.



Ensure the .dat file path is correct and accessible by the Python script.
Run the Flask server (python app.py), and keep it running.
